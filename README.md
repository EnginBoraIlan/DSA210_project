# TikTok, Instagram, and X Likes Analysis

## Motivation
Social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X have become integral to our daily lives, offering insights into personal behavior and engagement trends. This project aims to analyze social media engagement (likes and posts) to:
- Understand daily usage habits across platforms.
- Identify peak activity days.
- Explore the effects of **exam weeks on social media usage**, observing potential shifts in behavior during stressful periods.
- Gain self-awareness and insights into personal social media habits.

By combining data from multiple platforms, this project provides a holistic view of user engagement patterns.

## Data Sources
The data for this project is collected from:
1. **TikTok**: 
   - Exported personal activity data in a `.txt` format.
   - Includes timestamps of all liked videos.

2. **Instagram**:
   - Exported personal activity data in an `.html` format.
   - Includes timestamps of all liked posts.

3. **X (formerly Twitter)**:
   - Exported personal activity data in an `.html` format.
   - Includes liked posts and activity logs for further analysis.

All datasets are preprocessed to calculate daily engagement metrics. Sensitive information is excluded to maintain privacy.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To calculate and visualize the number of liked posts and videos per day on TikTok, Instagram, and X.
2. To merge and analyze data across platforms for a comprehensive view of daily social media activity.
3. To evaluate how engagement changes during exam weeks compared to regular periods.
4. To provide insights into overall social media usage patterns and trends.

## Tools and Methods
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` for visualizations.
  - `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML files (Instagram data).
- **Platform**: GitHub for hosting project materials and collaboration.
- **Output**:
  - A merged dataset summarizing daily activity across platforms.
  - Visualizations and reports highlighting usage patterns, including during exam weeks.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include X (formerly Twitter) usage data.
- Explore patterns in content types (e.g., videos, images, and tweets).
- Develop machine learning models to predict social media engagement trends.
- Analyze how time-sensitive events (e.g., exams, holidays) affect engagement across platforms.
